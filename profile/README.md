# ÆSR Lab – Applied/Experimental Sound Research Laboratory

This cooperative infrastructure research project
of the [University of Applied Arts Vienna](https://www.dieangewandte.at/), 
the [mdw – University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna](http://www.mdw.ac.at) ([Artistic Research Center](https://www.mdw.ac.at/ar_center/) and [Department for Composition, Electroacoustics and Tonmeister_innen-Education](https://www.mdw.ac.at/ike)) and 
the [Phonogrammarchiv of the Austrian Academy of Sciences](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/phonogrammarchiv/) is funded by the 
Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF) in cooperation with the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) of the EU.

The ÆSR Lab is a three-part, mobile and modular sound research laboratory at the interface of art and science, 
which as an infrastructure – with precise instrumentation and state-of-the-art technology – 
promotes interdisciplinary research and artistic design and helps to open up the development and testing of new technologies.

At mdw, the sub-project “ÆSR – sound projection laboratory” will be implemented in the years 2023–2026 under the direction of [Thomas Grill](https://www.mdw.ac.at/ar_center/team-grill/). 
The system to be developed within the framework of research and teaching will enable new and unconventional forms of spatial acoustic design 
for musical composition and performance.
